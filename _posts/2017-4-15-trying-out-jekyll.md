My portfolio site - kooljoy.com has been hosted by godaddy.com for quite some time. 
I needed to make some updates to the site and figured it would be better if I use github to host my site. 
This way I could push my changes with version control system which is definetly an advantage over just uploading files. 
I also wanted to migrate my wordpress blog to github's Jekyll blog. 

Unlike my godaddy setup where portfolio and blog were separate directory structures where the former was a simple html site and later a php powered blog, I wanted my github pages site to bundle portfolio and blog in the same directory structure. 

To get started with Jekyll I found this two helpful blog posts by 
[Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/){:target="_blank"} 
and [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll){:target="_blank"}.

Writing blog posts is definetly different than using wordpress. 
With wordpress you can create posts using admin section while in Jekyll you create posts 
in a separate text file that needs to  be named a certain way and created using Markdown/Kramdown.
